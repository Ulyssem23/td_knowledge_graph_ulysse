Recommendation strategy:
We could start with item-based collaborative filtering on the graph -> link products co-purchased in the same
orders and score candidates by co-occurrence (or Jaccard over customer sets). For users with sparse history,
we can also use personalized PageRank seeded on their viewed/bought items to find related products through categories
and co-purchase paths.

Production ready code:
Data handling should be made robust with ETL processes that safely upsert data without duplication,
schema migrations to handle structure changes, and proper indexing and validation for data integrity.
Regular scheduled jobs or change data capture can keep the graph synchronized with transactional systems.

Security should follow best practices: store secrets in a secure vault, enforce least-privilege database access,
enable TLS encryption, sanitize user inputs, and apply rate limiting.
