Why using merge and not create ?

We use MERGE instead of CREATE because using CREATE will always create new data, whereas MERGE will keep on using the data that
we currently have at hand.

Also, MERGE checks for duplicates and also finds existing patterns, which ensures graph integrity and prevents us from randomly
duplicating data that we don't need.

Overall, we use MERGE and not CREATE because MERGE keeps the graph clean and reuces complexity.
